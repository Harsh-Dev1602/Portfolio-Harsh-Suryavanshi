    <p className=' text-xl my-5 '>Hello! I’m Harsh Suryavanshi, a passionate and dedicated third-year student currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology at the Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and full-stack development, including the MERN stack, I am continually learning and evolving as I approach the final stages of my degree.</p>
    <p className=' text-xl mb-5 '>Throughout my academic journey, I have had the opportunity to work on various hands-on projects, including a To-Do List application and a QR Code Generator, as well as collaborating with peers on a Comprehensive Notes project as part of a minor. These experiences have not only helped me refine my technical skills but have also allowed me to grow as a problem-solver and communicator.</p>
    <p className=' text-xl mb-5 '>I am particularly interested in User Experience Design and website development, and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings. This portfolio showcases some of my best work to date, reflecting my growth, creativity, and dedication to my craft.</p>

    <p className=' text-xl mb-5 '>I am excited to continue building on these experiences and look forward to the future. Thank you for exploring my journey so far!Hello!
