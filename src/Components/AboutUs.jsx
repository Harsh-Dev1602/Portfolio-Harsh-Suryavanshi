    <p className=' text-xl my-5 '>Hello! I’m Harsh Suryavanshi, a passionate and dedicated third-year student currently pursuing a Information Technology at  Acropolis Institute of Technology & Research. With a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JS, Full-stack developer & MERN stack , I am constantly learning and evolving as I approach the final stages of my degree.</p>
    <p className=' text-xl mb-5 '>Throughout my academic journey, I’ve had the opportunity to work on a variety of hands-on projects, from To-Do List & QR-Generator to collaborating with peers on Comprehensive Notes in a Minor  project. These experiences have helped me not only refine my technical skills but also grow as a problem-solver and communicator.</p>
    <p className=' text-xl mb-5 '>I'm particularly interested in User Experience Design & website development, and I am eager to apply my knowledge and skills in real-world settings. This portfolio showcases some of my best work to date, reflecting my growth, creativity, and dedication to my craft.</p>

    <p className=' text-xl  '>I’m excited to continue building on these experiences and look forward to what the future holds. Thank you for exploring my journey so far!</p>
